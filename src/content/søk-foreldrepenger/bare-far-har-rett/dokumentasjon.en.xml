    <avsnitt>If the mother is receiving disability benefit, you may take up to 15 weeks at 100 per cent parental benefit, or 19 weeks at 80 per cent parental benefit without the mother having an activity requirement. These weeks must be taken before 46 weeks after the child was born if you choose 100 per cent parental benefit, or 56 weeks after the child was born if you choose 80 per cent parental benefit.</avsnitt> 
    <avsnitt>If you are taking more than these weeks, the mother must be working, studying or in another approved activity when you are at home with the child or if you are postponing parental benefit.</avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>If you are going to postpone the parental benefit period or work part-time, you must apply for this while there are still 15 or 19 weeks of the period of 46 or 56 weeks after the child is born. If you apply later, you will lose the number of days you apply too late. If you apply after 46 or 56 weeks, you will be declined. When you postpone, the mother must be at work, studying or in another approved activity. There is no requirement for the mother's activity when you take out the period you have postponed.</avsnitt>
