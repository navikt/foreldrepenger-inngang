    <avsnitt>When the mother works part-time, your parental benefits are reduced corresponding to the mother's working hours. If the mother's working hours is 75 per cent or more, the mother is considered to have a full position. You can then receive up to 100 per cent parental benefit.</avsnitt>
    <lesmer liten="true" intro="Is the mother receiving disability benefit?">
    <avsnitt>If the mother is receiving disability benefit, you may take up to 15 weeks at 100 per cent parental benefit, or 19 weeks at 80 per cent parental benefit without the mother having an activity requirement. These weeks must be taken before 46 weeks after the child was born if you choose 100 per cent parental benefit, or 56 weeks after the child was born if you choose 80 per cent parental benefit.</avsnitt> 
    <avsnitt>If you are taking more than these weeks, the mother must be working, studying or in another approved activity when you are at home with the child.  The same applies if you are going to have a break in parental benefits.</avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>If you are going to work part-time, you must apply for this while there are still 15 or 19 weeks of the period of 46 or 56 weeks after the child is born. If you apply later, you will lose the number of days you apply too late. If you apply after 46 or 56 weeks, you will be declined.</avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>If you are going to have a break in the parental benefit period, you must document motherâ€™s activity while 15 or 19 weeks remain of the period of 46 or 56 weeks after the baby is born.</avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>There is no requirement for the mother's activity when you take out the period of parental benefit.</avsnitt>
