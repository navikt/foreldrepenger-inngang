        The one who is the biological father of the child will normally be entitled to the entire parental benefit period as father 1. Your paternity as the biological father must be approved in Norway in order for you to be entitled to parental benefit.

        Father 2 may be entitled to the parental benefit if the stepchild adoption has been approved and there are still days remaining in the parental benefit period. However, you are not obliged to take the weeks that are allocated to you, such as in the case of adoption. This means that the biological father can take over your weeks, if this is more convenient for you.
