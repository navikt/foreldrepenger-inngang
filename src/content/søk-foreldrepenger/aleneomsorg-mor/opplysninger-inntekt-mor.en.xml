    <avsnitt>It is your employer who submits the income report.</avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>It can be a good idea to remind your employer of this when the time approaches. When you have applied, you will receive a document you can give your employer that will be useful when the employer is completing the income report. Your employer can see <lenke url="https://www.nav.no/no/bedrift/tjenester-og-skjemaer/nav-og-altinn-tjenester/inntektsmelding " ekstern="true">how to submit an income report</lenke>.</avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>If you are self-employed or freelance, you do not need to submit any documentation. We gather the information we need from public records and will contact you if we need more information.</avsnitt>
