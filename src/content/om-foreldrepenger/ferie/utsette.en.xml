    <lesmer intro="Length of postponement using annual leave">
        <avsnitt>You can apply to postpone your parental benefit period by taking annual leave (holiday) for up to 4 weeks and 1 day for each calendar year. In addition, you can postpone by using remaining holiday days from the previous calendar year and you can take up to 10 holiday days in advance from the coming year. Only the statutory part of your annual leave entitles you to postpone the parental benefit period.</avsnitt>
        <avsnitt>Statutory holiday means holiday (annual leave) pursuant to the Norwegian Holiday Act. Public holidays are not considered statutory holiday (annual leave), and you cannot postpone your parental benefit due to holiday on public holidays. If there are public holidays during the period you have taken annual leave, you will be paid parental benefit for these days.</avsnitt>

    <avsnitt>If you are an employee, you are entitled to holiday pay from the parental benefit. If your employer is paying you salary during your period of leave, the holiday pay is paid to your employer. </avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>The holiday pay amounts to 10.2 per cent of what is paid out before tax in the first 12 or 15 weeks of the parental benefit period. Holiday pay from NAV is paid in May the year after the right was accumulated.</avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>If only one of the parents has been paid parental benefit for the first 12 or 15 weeks, the other parent will not receive holiday pay.</avsnitt>
