    <avsnitt>If a child is born <b>before the 33rd week of pregnancy</b>, the parental benefit period is extended by the same number of weeks and days that the child was born before the due date. The parental benefit will be extended by the same period regardless of whether you give birth to one or more children, or if you have 100 per cent parental benefit or 80 per cent parental benefit.</avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>If the child is hospitalised after birth, you will usually be able to receive attendance allowance while the child is hospitalised. If you receive attendance allowance during the period from birth to the original due date, these days will be deducted from the extended period. If you receive attendance allowance according to the original due date, these days will not be deducted from the extended period. The parental benefit will <lenke url="#hvis-en-av-dere-blir-syke">be postponed</lenke> as long as the child is hospitalised, and does not start until the child is discharged from the hospital.
