    <avsnitt><b>If you are both adoptive parents</b></avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>The parent who starts as <b>father 2</b> will also receive <b>15 weeks</b> allocated to you. You can take the weeks together, divide these up or combine them with work. Your weeks must be taken no later than the end of the joint period or you must apply for a postponement. If you get so sick that you are completely dependent on assistance for taking care of the child, father 1 can apply to take over your weeks.</avsnitt>
    <avsnitt><b>If you adopt a child as a stepchild</b></avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>You will be entitled to the parental benefit if the stepchild adoption has been approved and there are still days remaining in the parental benefit period. However, you are not obligated to take the weeks that are allocated to you, such as in the case of adoption. This means that the <b>biological father can take over</b> your weeks, if this is more convenient for you.</avsnitt>
