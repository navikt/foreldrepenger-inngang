    <avsnitt>Your parental benefit is usually calculated as the average of your income in <b>the last three years for which tax has been assessed</b>.</avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>If your business or work situation has changed permanently, the income you have when your parental benefit period starts is used instead. Income over 12 times the National Insurance basic amount (“G”) is not included in the calculation.</avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>The same rules also apply if you are <b>receiving sickness benefit, parental or pregnancy benefit </b>or benefit in connection with caring for <b>sick children.</b></avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>If you are both <b>self-employed and a freelancer or employed</b>, your parental benefit will be calculated based on both of your incomes. Your freelance income will always be used as the basis for calculation. Freelance income up to six times the National Insurance basic amount (“G”) is always covered in full.</avsnitt>
