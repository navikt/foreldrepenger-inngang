    <avsnitt class="blokk-m">Accumulating rights to the parental benefit is the same as for the birth of a child. The same applies to the calculation of the parental benefit.</avsnitt>
    <lesmer intro="When does the parental benefit period commence?">
        <avsnitt>If you adopt from abroad, you can select when you would like to start receiving the parental benefit:</avsnitt>
        <liste>
            <punkt>when you assume care of the child while abroad</punkt>
            <punkt>the day you arrive in Norway with the child. If you start later, you will receive fewer weeks.</punkt>
        </liste>
        <avsnitt>You may choose yourselves as to who will be home during the period of leave. When the father shall receive the parental benefit from the joint period, the rules as for birth apply and there are <lenke url="#hvor-lenge-kan-du-fa-foreldrepenger">activity requirements</lenke> for the mother.</avsnitt>
    </lesmer>
    <lesmer intro="How long can you receive the parental benefit?">
        <avsnitt>The parental benefit period is 46 weeks if you select 100 per cent parental benefit or 56 weeks at 80 per cent parental benefit.</avsnitt>
        <avsnitt>The weeks are shared between the parents in the same manner as the parental benefit in connection with birth.<lenke url="#hvor-lenge-kan-du-fa-foreldrepenger">the parental benefit in connection with birth.</lenke></avsnitt>
    </lesmer>
    <lesmer intro="Are you adopting more than one child?">
        <avsnitt>If you adopt more than one child at the same time, you will receive more weeks of parental benefit. These extra weeks are called “multiple children weeks” and can be taken at any time during the parental benefit period. The parents can take them at the same time or separately. There is no requirement regarding what the mother is doing when the father or co-mother is taking days from the multiple children weeks.</avsnitt>
        <liste>
            <punkt>If you adopt <b>2 children</b>, you will receive 17 extra weeks at 100 per cent parental benefit and 21 extra weeks at 80 per cent parental benefit.</punkt>
            <punkt>If you adopt <b>3 or more children</b>, you will receive 46 extra weeks at 100 per cent parental benefit and 56 extra weeks at 80 per cent parental benefit.</punkt>

    <lesmer intro="Mother has disability benefits">
        <avsnitt>If the mother is on disability benefits, the father can take up to 15 weeks at 100 per cent parental benefit, or 19 weeks at 80 per cent parental benefit without there being any activity requirement for the mother. These weeks must be taken within 46 weeks after taking over the care if he chooses 100 per cent parental benefit, or 56 weeks after taking over the care if he chooses 80 per cent parental benefit. If the father is to take more than these weeks, the mother must be at work, studying or in another approved activity when the father is to be at home with the child or if he is to postpone the parental benefit.</avsnitt>
        <avsnitt>If the father is to postpone the parental benefit period or work part-time, he must apply for this while there are still 15 or 19 weeks of the period of 46 or 56 weeks after taking over the care. If the father applies at a later date, he loses the number of days he applies late. If the father applies after 46 or 56 weeks, he will be denied. When the father postpones, the mother must be at work, studying or in another approved activity. There is no requirement for the mother's activity when the father is to take the period he has postponed.</avsnitt>
