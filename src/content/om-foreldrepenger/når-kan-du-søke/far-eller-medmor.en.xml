    <avsnitt class="blokk-xxs">The <b>father or co-mother</b> cannot apply for parental benefit until the <b>child has been born</b>. An exception will be made if the mother is ill or is in hospital or another health institution. In this case, you must send a paper application by post.</avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>You must apply at the latest on the day before the motherâ€™s last day of parental benefit. If you apply later than this, you will have correspondingly fewer days of parental benefit.</avsnitt>
