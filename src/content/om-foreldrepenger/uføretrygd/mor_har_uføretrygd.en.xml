    <avsnitt>If the mother is on disability benefits, the father can take up to 15 weeks at 100 per cent parental benefit, or 19 weeks at 80 per cent parental benefit without there being any activity requirement for the mother. These weeks must be taken within 46 weeks after taking over care if he chooses 100 per cent parental benefit, or 56 weeks after taking over care if he chooses 80 per cent parental benefit. If the father is to take more than these weeks, the mother must be at work, studying or in another approved activity when the father is to be at home with the child, or if he is to postpone the parental benefit.</avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>If the father is to postpone the parental benefit period or work part-time, he must apply for this while there are still 15 or 19 weeks of the period of 46 or 56 weeks after taking over the care. If the father applies at a later date, he loses the number of days he applies late. If the father applies after 46 or 56 weeks, he will be denied. When the father postpones, the mother must be at work, studying or in another approved activity. There is no requirement for the mother's activity when the father is to take the period he has postponed.</avsnitt>
