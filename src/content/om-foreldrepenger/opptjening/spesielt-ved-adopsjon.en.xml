    <avsnitt>When you adopt a child, you can choose whether you want to start receiving parental benefit on the date you assume care of the child, or when the child arrives in Norway if you are adopting from abroad. The same requirements that you must have worked for six of the last ten months before you start receiving parental benefit apply.</avsnitt>
    <avsnitt class="blokk-m">If both parents are entitled to parental benefit, you can choose which of you receives parental benefit first. Even if the father is taking his period of parental benefit first, the mother must be entitled to parental benefit at the time of assumption of care or the date the child arrives in Norway.</avsnitt>
