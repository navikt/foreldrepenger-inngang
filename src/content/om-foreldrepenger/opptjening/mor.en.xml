    <avsnitt>When checking to see whether mothers are entitled to parental benefit, we include income up to three weeks before the child is born. If you give birth before the expected date of delivery, you must have earned entitlement to parental benefit by the day before the child was born.</avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>Any time you work after three weeks before the expected date of delivery does not count as income in six of the past ten months.</avsnitt>
    <avsnitt>If you know that you are going to leave your job more than three weeks before the expected date of delivery, it might be a good idea to start drawing parental benefit earlier to ensure that you are entitled to parental benefit when you apply. The same applies if you know that you will no longer receive payments from NAV for a period before you start receiving parental benefit. The earliest you can start drawing parental benefit is 12 weeks before the expected date of delivery.</avsnitt>
